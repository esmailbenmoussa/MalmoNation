# What is it about?
Malmö Nation is an association of students studying at Lund University. We provide opportunities for the student to meet, rest and further develop in addition to their studies.

# Description
Malmö Nation was founded in 1890 and we have since been a Nation with the traditions preserved. We have a wide range of activities for all interests. With approximately 2,700 members, 37 different committees and 500 active members, Malmö Nation is one of the largest nations in Lund.

Malmö Nation is located in the middle of Lund between Östra Vallgatan and Stora tomegatan. At Östra Vallgatan 51 you will find the expedition and the Pub. On the other side of the houses, on Stora tomegatan, is our recreation room.
